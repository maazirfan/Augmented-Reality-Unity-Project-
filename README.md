Use this code attached this on camera and then add plane or sphere which you want to show you camera view on it, and then drop your plane/sphere on you scipt component.
and if you want show some object in front of your camera view AR then add new cube delete its mesh renederer and then adjust the boundary so the moving object cant go else. 
or if you want to make it a FPS shooter game then all you need to make UI canvas button and then place your enemy script on it and drop your button on that one.
and to make a bullet you dont need any fbx or model, just make a normal 3d shpere adjust it measurements and then create a prefab name it as bullet because it will retreave it from resource folder as a prefab, and then intentiate it as fire button pressed . so delete it from editor after saving it as prefab.
